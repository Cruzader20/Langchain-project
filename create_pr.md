## PR Title

Fix AgentResponse object access error in WebSocket endpoint
```

## PR Description
```markdown
## Summary

This PR fixes a critical error in the WebSocket endpoint where AgentResponse objects were being accessed incorrectly, causing the agent system to fail silently.

## Problem
The error `'AgentResponse' object has no attribute 'get'` occurred because:
1. Code was trying to use `.get()` method on Pydantic AgentResponse objects
2. Code was trying to unpack Pydantic objects directly with `**response`

## Solution
- Changed `response.get('agentId', 'unknown')` to `response.agentId`
- Changed `**response` to `**response.model_dump()` for proper dictionary conversion
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Created test files to verify the fix

## Changes Made
- Modified `backend/main.py` to properly handle AgentResponse objects
- Added `backend/test_fix.py` for verification
- Enhanced error handling throughout the agent processing pipeline

## Testing
- ✅ All agents now respond correctly to WebSocket messages
- ✅ AgentResponse objects can be properly serialized to JSON
- ✅ WebSocket endpoint no longer throws AttributeError

## Impact
This fix resolves the issue where users would send messages but receive no responses from agents. The multi-agent system now works as intended.
